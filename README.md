# SpaceX Launch Success Prediction Project ðŸš€

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the success of SpaceX launches based on historical launch data. The objective is to build a machine learning model that can determine the likelihood of a successful launch. The project showcases advanced data science techniques, including data wrangling, web scraping, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and multiple machine learning models to provide an accurate solution to the business problem.

## Problem Statement

SpaceX aims to make space exploration more affordable through the reuse of rocket boosters. The goal of this project is to predict the outcome (success/failure) of these launches based on various factors like orbit, payload, and landing outcomes.

By analyzing historical data and predicting launch success rates, SpaceX can enhance decision-making for future missions, optimizing costs and improving mission planning.

## Key Features

- **Data Wrangling:** Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and ensuring the data is in a usable format.
  
- **Web Scraping:** Data collection from public resources using BeautifulSoup and requests to gather up-to-date SpaceX launch data.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Advanced data visualization using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to understand patterns in launch success based on different features such as orbit, payload mass, and booster version.

- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

  Models were optimized using GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for predicting the success of SpaceX launches.

- **Model Evaluation:** Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC were used to evaluate the performance of the models.

## Business Insights
