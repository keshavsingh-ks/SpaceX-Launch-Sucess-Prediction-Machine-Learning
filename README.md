# SpaceX-Launch Sucess Prediction-Machine Learning
 
SpaceX Launch Success Prediction Using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project aims to predict the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 launches using historical data. Leveraging various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), the project identifies critical factors influencing launch outcomes. Data was scraped from Wikipedia, cleaned, and processed for model building. The analysis provides insights that can assist SpaceX in optimizing their future launches and increasing the success rate.

Business Problem
SpaceX, a leading aerospace manufacturer, is continuously striving to improve the success rate of its rocket launches. Each failed launch incurs significant financial losses. Hence, predicting whether a launch will be successful based on historical data is crucial for SpaceX’s operational efficiency. This project offers a solution by analyzing previous Falcon 9 launches and building machine learning models to forecast future launch outcomes.

Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

To perform web scraping to gather historical data of SpaceX Falcon 9 launches.
To clean and preprocess the data for machine learning model training.
To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful insights.
To build and optimize machine learning models to predict launch success.
To evaluate the model performances and provide actionable insights to SpaceX.
Key Techniques Used
Web Scraping: Scraped data from Wikipedia pages using BeautifulSoup.
Data Wrangling: Cleaned and prepared the dataset, handled missing values, and formatted date/time fields.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used visualizations to uncover patterns and relationships in the dataset.
Machine Learning: Multiple models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and KNN, were built and optimized using GridSearchCV to predict launch outcomes.
Model Evaluation: Models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
Project Workflow
Data Collection:

Web scraped historical SpaceX launch data from Wikipedia.
Extracted information such as date, launch site, payload, orbit, and outcome.
Data Wrangling:
